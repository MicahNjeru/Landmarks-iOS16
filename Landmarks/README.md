#  Landmarks iOS 16
## Introduction
- This is an iOS 16 application I have built by learning from Apple on how to build iPhone apps 
- The tutorial can be found (here)[https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui]

### What's in the app
- An beautifully organized list view of various park destinations across the US with pictures included
- A __featured__ view with the parks organized in their respecitve categories: lakes, mountains and rivers
- A list view that lists all parks in one vertical view with a filter toggle button to hide/unhide favorite parks
- A map view on every detailed view displaying the exact region of the park's location using Apple maps
- A user profile view with an edit view that saves data to the application's data model
- A button configured on every detailed view of the park to add/remove to the favorites list  

### What I've learnt
How to:
    1. add, modify and connect multiple views
    2. pass data across multiple views
    3. decode and use json data
    4. use Mapkit
    5. animate views
    6. add and modify charts

### Recommendations and what's next
1. Work on this app to improve its usablity and user interface
2. Reinforce the skills I've learnt from working on this project
3. Repeat step 1 & 2 because this building iOS apps using SwiftUI is fun!!!
